# Auto-SeQure
The script to automatically go through the Queen's SeQure app confirmation survey that you don't have COVID..
So, don't use this if you have COVID symptoms because you will be lying.

Make sure you have the `requirments.txt` libraries installed. The version doesn't matter too much.

This system runs "headless" meaning it doesn't need a monitor to operate, you can put it on a RaspberryPi or something if you wanted.

Enjoy!
